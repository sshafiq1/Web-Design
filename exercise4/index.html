                        <p>the exhibit itself was an experience, dimmed lighting and silky maroon curtains. i felt like there should have been a low piano playing and maybe a chair to lounge on...well, actually there were many chairs, but not many of them looked very comfortable.</p>

                        <p>many chairs but no couches, or beds. the world's most sterile kitchen. unused post-its, fresh paper bags, and chairs. chairs that probably no one has ever sat on. a sheet of crinkly, shiny cloth. but all these ideas came from chairs that were sat on, ideas that were conversed across couches and beds, pens that were half-used and forgotten, crumpled papers and teared up fabric. the exhibit's sterilty poked out from underneath its dark atmosphere and hushed audience. is good design supposed to be so untouched?</p>

                        <p>many of the objects were the most simple iterations of themselves: yellow post-its, black and blue BIC pens, a white lawn chair-their most ubitious manifestations.</p>

                        <p>it didn't feel like an exhibit on design. it felt like an exhibit on humanity. this is a handwash station we used during covid. this was invented to stop kids from being blown up by land mines. you would be able to see this wind map if our funding hadn't been cut. in the meanwhile, we found it worthwhile to make a chair that nobody really needs, a chest of drawers thats meant to be seen more than used, or a cup that functions no better than ur own cupped hands.</p>
