                        <p>it didn't feel like an exhibit on design. it felt like an exhibit on humanity. this is a handwash station we used during covid. this was invented to stop kids from being blown up by land mines. you would be able to see this wind map if our funding hadn't been cut. in the meanwhile, we found it worthwhile to make a chair that nobody really needs, a chest of drawers thats meant to be seen more than used, or a cup that functions no better than ur own cupped hands.</p>
